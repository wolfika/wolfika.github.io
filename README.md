## How to use
Clone this repository and run `npm install` (or highly recommended: `yarn`).

### npm commands:

* `npm start` <br>
  Starts a development server running on `localhost:8080`. Automatically watches for changes, recompiles and autoreloads 👍

* `npm build` <br>
  Builds the entire project, optimizing it along the way. Built files are located in the `dist` directory.

* `npm run build:dev` <br>
  Builds the project, but no optimizations are done.

* `npm run lint` <br>
  Lints all files in `src`, because linting is awesome and helps you produce better code 🎉
